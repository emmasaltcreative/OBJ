# Oh Betty Jaletti — Custom Shopify Theme

A bespoke Online Store 2.0 theme for **Maison Betty Jaletti** · *petits plaisirs, faits exprès*.

## Design language

- **Palette** — cream paper (`#F6F1E7`), warm ink (`#26221B`), bordeaux accent (`#7E2F2A`), ticking-stripe blue (`#3D4E6E`). All editable under **Theme settings → Colors**.
- **Type** — Cormorant Garamond (display serif), Lora (body), Jost (letterspaced small caps for eyebrows & buttons).
- **Voice baked in** — "Your parcel" instead of cart, "Between editions" instead of sold out, the fulfillment promise on every product page, the letter on the homepage.

## Structure

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `sections/hero.liquid` | Editorial homepage hero |
| `sections/purse-hero.liquid` | In Her Purse debut landing hero |
| `sections/purse-tote.liquid` | The Brownstone Tote, No. 1 of the debut |
| `templates/page.in-her-purse.json` | Landing page template for the debut |
| `sections/edition-grid.liquid` | "The First Edition" numbered product grid (No. 1–4) |
| `sections/the-letter.liquid` | Letter-from-the-maison excerpt with drop cap & signature |
| `sections/ritual.liquid` | I / II / III made-to-order value props |
| `sections/marquee.liquid` | Scrolling ribbon of house phrases |
| `sections/main-product.liquid` | Product page with edition number, custom CTA, accordions |
| `snippets/sample-form.liquid` | "Grab a sample" — free scented card, posted to an address |
| `snippets/has-sample.liquid` | Decides which products offer a sample |
| `templates/page.the-letter.json` | Full About / "Our Why" letter page |

## Product metafields (optional but recommended)

Create these under **Settings → Custom data → Products**:

| Namespace & key | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `custom.edition_number` | Integer | `1` → renders "No. 1" |
| `custom.cta_label` | Single line text | `Escort my paperback →` |
| `custom.preorder` | Boolean | `true` → sell as a preorder |
| `custom.free_sample` | Boolean | `true` → offer a free scented sample (`false` → never) |

Without them the theme falls back to grid position for numbering and "Add to my parcel →" for the button.

## Getting it onto Shopify

```bash
# from this directory
shopify theme dev    # live preview against your store
shopify theme push --unpublished --theme "Oh Betty Jaletti"
```

Or zip the folder and upload via **Online Store → Themes → Add theme → Upload zip file**.

## Landing page: In Her Purse

The homepage is the debut landing for **In Her Purse**. The first piece is **The Brownstone Tote by Betty** — brown suede, a flowered scarf knotted at the handle, No. 1. The photograph ships with the theme at `assets/brownstone-tote.jpg`.

The same landing is the `page.in-her-purse` template. Create a page with handle `in-her-purse` and assign that template if you want the debut at its own address as well.

Until a product with handle `the-brownstone-tote` exists, the page asks for an address and tags the customer `in-her-purse`. Once that product is published, the landing sells it at the variant price and the button reads "Claim the tote →". Assign the **brownstone** product template so the product page carries the suede, scarf, and shipping notes. No price is invented here — set it on the variant.

The Chaperone preorder stays at `/products/the-chaperone`, and the landing links to it.

## Preorder: The Chaperone at $79

The Chaperone — a coat for the paperback, No. 1 in the first edition — can be preordered at **$79**. The customer is charged today; the piece is cut when the edition opens and ships with it.

1. In Shopify admin, go to **Products → Import** and upload [`the-chaperone.csv`](the-chaperone.csv). That file is catalog data, not a theme asset — import it; don't rely on a theme zip to create the product. It publishes:
   - Handle `the-chaperone`
   - Price **$79.00**
   - Tag `preorder`
   - Template suffix `preorder` (uses `templates/product.preorder.json`)
   - Inventory left untracked, with policy **continue**, so the preorder stays open before any are made
2. Add **The Chaperone** to the **First Edition** collection and pick that collection in the homepage edition grid.
3. Leave the variant price at **$79.00**. The product page, homepage preorder, and announcement all sell that price. The charged amount is the variant price; the homepage shows `$79` only until the product exists.

A product sells as a preorder when any of these are true: template suffix `preorder`, tag `preorder`, handle `the-chaperone`, or metafield `custom.preorder` is true. Adding it to the parcel writes line-item properties `Preorder: Yes` and `Ships: With the first edition`, which follow the order into checkout.

To close the preorder, track inventory, set the policy to **deny**, and set quantity to 0. The button then reads "Preorder closed."

## Free samples: smell it before you buy

Scented products carry a free-sample offer: a card scented by hand, folded into a house
envelope and closed with a wax seal. Nothing is charged.

- **On the product page** — a disclosure under the add-to-parcel button, "Grab a sample — free".
  It opens a form that requires a physical address (street, city, postal code, country), because
  the card goes by post.
- **On a collection page** — a bordeaux wax seal on the product's photograph reading
  *Free sample · Smell it before you buy*, linking to the form at `/products/<handle>#sample`.
  The same seal appears anywhere the product card is used, including the homepage edition grid.

A product offers a sample when any of these are true: metafield `custom.free_sample` is true,
tagged `sample` or `free-sample`, tagged `fragrance`, handle `a-woman-remembered`, or the product
type reads parfum / perfume / fragrance / cologne / scent. It is withheld when
`custom.free_sample` is false, the product is tagged `no-sample`, or samples are switched off
in theme settings. **A Woman Remembered** is tagged `fragrance`, so it qualifies as it stands.

The form is a Shopify **contact** form, so no app is needed: every field — name, email, street
address, apartment, city, state, postal code, country, and an optional note — arrives in the
store's contact notification, ready to address an envelope from. It also carries the product
title and URL, and an optional "write to me when a new edition opens" checkbox. Requests land
wherever **Settings → Notifications → Contact** is sent.

All of the copy lives under **Theme settings → Free samples** (sticker text, heading, intro,
button, note, thank-you). Per product page, the offer can be hidden with the Product section's
**Offer a free sample** checkbox.

## After upload

1. Import **The Chaperone** (above), then create the **First Edition** collection with the four products (The Chaperone, The Good Lines, One More Chapter, The Good Glass) and pick it in the homepage "Edition grid" section.
2. Create a page with handle `the-letter` using the **page.the-letter** template for the full About letter.
3. Set the `main-menu` and `footer` navigation menus.
4. Add the metafields above for per-product CTAs and edition numbers.
