# Oh Betty Jaletti — Custom Shopify Theme

A bespoke Online Store 2.0 theme for **Maison Betty Jaletti** · *petits plaisirs, faits exprès*.

## Design language

- **Palette** — cream paper (`#F6F1E7`), warm ink (`#26221B`), bordeaux accent (`#7E2F2A`), ticking-stripe blue (`#3D4E6E`). All editable under **Theme settings → Colors**.
- **Type** — Cormorant Garamond (display serif), Lora (body), Jost (letterspaced small caps for eyebrows & buttons).
- **Voice baked in** — "Your parcel" instead of cart, "Between editions" instead of sold out, the fulfillment promise on every product page, the letter on the homepage.

## Structure

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `sections/hero.liquid` | Editorial homepage hero |
| `sections/purse-hero.liquid` | In Her Purse debut landing hero |
| `sections/purse-tote.liquid` | The Brownstone Tote, No. 1 of the debut |
| `templates/page.in-her-purse.json` | Landing page template for the debut |
| `sections/edition-grid.liquid` | "The First Edition" numbered product grid (No. 1–4) |
| `sections/the-letter.liquid` | Letter-from-the-maison excerpt with drop cap & signature |
| `sections/ritual.liquid` | I / II / III made-to-order value props |
| `sections/marquee.liquid` | Scrolling ribbon of house phrases |
| `sections/main-product.liquid` | Product page with edition number, custom CTA, accordions |
| `templates/page.the-letter.json` | Full About / "Our Why" letter page |

## Product metafields (optional but recommended)

Create these under **Settings → Custom data → Products**:

| Namespace & key | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `custom.edition_number` | Integer | `1` → renders "No. 1" |
| `custom.cta_label` | Single line text | `Escort my paperback →` |
| `custom.preorder` | Boolean | `true` → sell as a preorder |

Without them the theme falls back to grid position for numbering and "Add to my parcel →" for the button.

## Getting it onto Shopify

```bash
# from this directory
shopify theme dev    # live preview against your store
shopify theme push --unpublished --theme "Oh Betty Jaletti"
```

Or zip the folder and upload via **Online Store → Themes → Add theme → Upload zip file**.

## Landing page: In Her Purse

The homepage is the debut landing for **In Her Purse**. The first piece is **The Brownstone Tote by Betty** — brown suede, a flowered scarf knotted at the handle, No. 1. The photograph ships with the theme at `assets/brownstone-tote.jpg`.

The same landing is the `page.in-her-purse` template. Create a page with handle `in-her-purse` and assign that template if you want the debut at its own address as well.

Until a product with handle `the-brownstone-tote` exists, the page asks for an address and tags the customer `in-her-purse`. Once that product is published, the landing sells it at the variant price and the button reads "Claim the tote →". Assign the **brownstone** product template so the product page carries the suede, scarf, and shipping notes. No price is invented here — set it on the variant.

The Chaperone preorder stays at `/products/the-chaperone`, and the landing links to it.

## Preorder: The Chaperone at $79

The Chaperone — a coat for the paperback, No. 1 in the first edition — can be preordered at **$79**. The customer is charged today; the piece is cut when the edition opens and ships with it.

1. In Shopify admin, go to **Products → Import** and upload [`the-chaperone.csv`](the-chaperone.csv). That file is catalog data, not a theme asset — import it; don't rely on a theme zip to create the product. It publishes:
   - Handle `the-chaperone`
   - Price **$79.00**
   - Tag `preorder`
   - Template suffix `preorder` (uses `templates/product.preorder.json`)
   - Inventory left untracked, with policy **continue**, so the preorder stays open before any are made
2. Add **The Chaperone** to the **First Edition** collection and pick that collection in the homepage edition grid.
3. Leave the variant price at **$79.00**. The product page, homepage preorder, and announcement all sell that price. The charged amount is the variant price; the homepage shows `$79` only until the product exists.

A product sells as a preorder when any of these are true: template suffix `preorder`, tag `preorder`, handle `the-chaperone`, or metafield `custom.preorder` is true. Adding it to the parcel writes line-item properties `Preorder: Yes` and `Ships: With the first edition`, which follow the order into checkout.

To close the preorder, track inventory, set the policy to **deny**, and set quantity to 0. The button then reads "Preorder closed."

## After upload

1. Import **The Chaperone** (above), then create the **First Edition** collection with the four products (The Chaperone, The Good Lines, One More Chapter, The Good Glass) and pick it in the homepage "Edition grid" section.
2. Create a page with handle `the-letter` using the **page.the-letter** template for the full About letter.
3. Set the `main-menu` and `footer` navigation menus.
4. Add the metafields above for per-product CTAs and edition numbers.

## Agentic knowledge base: `/agents.md`

`templates/agents.md.liquid` is the house's agent-facing knowledge base. Shopify serves it at
`/agents.md`, and — unless separate `llms.txt.liquid` / `llms-full.txt.liquid` templates are added —
the same content at `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt`. It replaces Shopify's generic managed file,
which carries UCP and MCP discovery but nothing about the house, the editions, or the policies.

It holds: how to transact (Shop skill, UCP/MCP, WebMCP), the house story and vocabulary, every
purchasable piece with price, materials and dimensions, the pieces that are announced but not yet
published, preorder terms, shipping and returns, the policy and page map, and rules for answering
questions about the house.

Two things to keep in mind when editing it:

- **The Liquid context is restricted.** Only `request` and `agents` are available. `shop`,
  `collections`, `product`, `pages` and the rest render blank. Pull UCP and MCP values from the
  `agents` object so they stay in sync; everything else is hardcoded, which is why the file carries
  a review date.
- **Re-review it whenever the catalog or a policy moves** — a new edition, a published draft, a
  price change, a ship window, a shipping rate. Prices and availability are labelled as
  point-in-time, with the MCP endpoint and `/products/{handle}.json` named as authoritative, but
  stale copy in this file still misleads an agent.

Deploy it the same way as the rest of the theme:

```bash
shopify theme push --only templates/agents.md.liquid
```

Or paste it into **Online Store → Themes → … → Edit code → templates → Add a new template**.
Check it afterwards at `https://ohbettyjaletti.com/agents.md`.
